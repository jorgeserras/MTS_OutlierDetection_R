
File "formatted_mortality.csv" possess in a single subject, the male mortality rates in France of specific ages (from 0 to 90, being X1 to X91) through time slices (span of 198 years).

Some discrete files are present which were obtained using SAX (without PAA).

The "subset" folder has the corresponding files, but for the datasets with solely 5 and 6 variables, which used the datasets in the "original/subset" folder.


Files terminating in "_NORMALIZED" have a different structure. Since SAX needs univariable normalization, each column represents the values of each age being the rows the time slice (year).
In the image (.png), each curve represents an age as seen by SAX.
