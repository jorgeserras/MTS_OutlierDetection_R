
The two folders "B" and "C" possess datasets containing MTS subjects generated by two stationary first-order DBNs (B and C). These MTS are considered outliers. The datasets also include normal subjects generated by a "normal" DBN, common for both folders.

For additional information aswell as the structure used, please refer to the paper.

Each file inside one of the folders has the syntax: "artificial_OutlierDBN_PercentageOutlier_NumberSubjects", the "PercentageOutlier" represents the persentage of outlier subjects in the dataset, which were formed by "OutlierDBN". The "NumberSubjects" is the total ammount of MTS in the dataset.
