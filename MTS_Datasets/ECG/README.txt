
"ECG_original.csv" is the original data. However, the attributes were X and timestamps were switched. The dataset is supposed to have 2 variables along 39 slices. Such was fixed and saved in file "ECG_TRAINTEST_APPROPRIATE.csv".

File "ECG_TRAINTEST_APPROPRIATE.csv" is the appropriate one to insert in the application. A single subject is present as an example ("ECG_TRAINTEST_APPROPRIATE_subject1"). A SAX discretization is made available, which can also be introduced to the system.
